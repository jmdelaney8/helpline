# Progress

- - Finally making calls!

# Todo
- Figure out why we can't get past the language selection. Is the app closing the call?
- Figure out why we we crashed after trying to send the third dtmf: "No close frame received or sent
- Figure out why it takes so long between detecting silence and beginning to transcribe the audio


# Next
- Make it a web app with monitoring/observability
- Secure the web app :shrug:
- Use the openai agent api instead? Don't really understand the difference
