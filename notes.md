# Progress

- Really almost working!

# Todo
- Have the agent summarize the call log at the end 
- properly hang up the call
- make the agent server a proper server where new sessions get a new agent


# Next
- Make it a web app with monitoring/observability
- Secure the web app :shrug:
- Use the openai agent api instead? Don't really understand the difference
