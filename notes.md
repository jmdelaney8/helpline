# Progress

- Trying to make a basic web app

# Todo
- make sure it all works
- send final result back to web app
- then send incremental updates
- clean up terminal output while we are at it
- something is broken about the language trnascription, spams the spanish portion


# Next
- Make it a web app with monitoring/observability
- Secure the web app :shrug:
- Use the openai agent api instead? Don't really understand the difference
